# Simple React App that displays a list of Marvel characters

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The purpose of this app is to train on the following :
- retrieve data from a REST API, page by page, and display Marvel characters
- store some data within a context
- filter out the list with a search field 
- allow to select favorite characters and list them in another page
- use a few Ant Design components
